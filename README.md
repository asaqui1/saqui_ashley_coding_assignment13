# saqui_ashley_ui_garden - Assignment 13

## What This Project Is

This is the **Assignment 13** version of my React Component Library from Assignment 12.
In this assignment, I added:

- Code quality checks with **Prettier**, **ESLint**, and **Jest tests**
- **Husky** pre-commit hooks so code is checked before every commit
- **Lint-staged** to run checks only on files that are being committed
- A **Docker container** to run the production version of the app on `localhost:8018`
- A **CI/CD workflow** with GitHub Actions to check code when it is pushed
